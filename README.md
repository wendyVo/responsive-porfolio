# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

### Project Description

* Using Bootstrap, recreate your portfolio site with the following items:

   * A navbar

   * A responsive layout

   * Responsive images

* The Bootstrap portfolio should minimize the use of media queries.


### Hints

* Use Bootstrap's grid system (containers, rows, and columns).

* On an `xs` screen, content should take up the entire screen. On `sm` and larger screens, you should have some margins on the left and right sides of the screen. Check out various sites on your mobile device vs. your computer to see examples of these differences.


### Minimum Requirements

* Functional, deployed application

* GitHub repository with README describing the project
